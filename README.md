# 42KL-M1-ft_printf
This repository contains my work on 42KL's ft_printf. It's 1 of 3 projects for Milestone 1.

The main objective of this project is to create a function that replicates the basic C function: printf. The file should also be able handle variadic functions, just like the original.

I didn't submit my work with the the bonus objectives. It requires the file to manage any combination of the following flags: ’-0.’ and all of ’# +’ flags.
